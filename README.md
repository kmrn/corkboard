# corkboard
Corkboard is a social bulletin board thing I created in a couple hours in order to teach myself how to use Meteor's MVCs and React. It also uses MongoDB and ES6.

Post a thing on the public bulletin board and then everyone can see it appear on there in real time along with how long ago it was posted. You can also like individual posts as many times as you want and people can see those get updated in real time too.
